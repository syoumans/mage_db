mage_db
=========
These SQP dumps have been generated using n98-magerun.phar, unless otherwise noted.

The initial release was generated using the command:
  n98-magerun db:dump --strip="@development @idx"
  
  This command suppresses index, customer, and order information from the dump.

To import this dB, you can use the n-98-magerun command: 
  n98-magerun db:import [filename]
